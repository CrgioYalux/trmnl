# trmnl  
A terminal <sub><sup>*(not really)*</sup></sub> in the browser.  
Made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). What a surprise, am i right.

### Why
I've been using Linux (*i use arch btw*) for like a year and a half now, and I kinda don't want to go back to Windows where I always, somehow, managed to have many problems when using it for developing.  
Had to go from a dev environment where I'd barely use the terminal (almost completely limited to using it for git and running vim), to a dev environment where if I want to do even the minimal operation (like CRUD operations with directories and files), I have to run some command.  

So basically, with this project, I wanted to **implement some of those minimal operations that I have used in a pseudo terminal usable from the browser**.

### Some screenshoots

- Commands `tree`, `help` and `history`  
![Running commands tree, help and history](/docs/images/1.png)  
The user's home directory can only be accessed as '~'.  

- Commands `mkdir` and `rm`

Relative and absolute paths can be used.
